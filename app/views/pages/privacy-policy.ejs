<b>my privacy policy (a love story)</b><br/>
<br/>
yo, heres a list of the info i collect on you because im required to tell you that by law;<br/>
i dont collect any data on you specifically per se,<br/>
just like, statistics and stuff (in technical terms i mask the last two bytes of anyone's ip)<br/>
anyway,<br/>
i check which countries people visit my site from,<br/>
i check how visited each page is,<br/>
i check how cool my users are (jk theyre all pretty cool (that includes you too (unless you sue me for having a bad privacy policy (pls dont do that im poor (pls))))),<br/>
and also from which site did you come from.<br/>
<br/>
i pretty much use that info to sorta see if there are any spikes in the site usage, and what caused those spikes so that i can plan my marketing better,<br/>
how many "fans" or so do i have so that i can plan ahead and know my community,<br/>
and also like, reorginize my site so that it can be more effective<br/>
<br/>
i dont use google analytics cause google sux lol<br/>
the analytics service i use is matomo (aka piwik, a real shame they changed their name to matomo, piwik sounds way cooler)<br/>
but like i turned off cookie collections so you aint got no cookies on your computer (cookies are small files that are saved on your computer, sorta like save files but for websites)<br/>
<br/>
oh also if anyone threatens me with guns n shit to hand the info i *will* hand them the info so keep that in mind.<br/>
but also like, its all anonymous so you shouldnt worry<br/>
<br/>
if you have any questions hmu on twitter dms or send me an email at arihanan@pm.me<br/>
<br/>
alright thnx for coming to my ted talk, lov yall
