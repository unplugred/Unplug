		description: `hi! ✌<br/>
im melody (she they). on the internet i release stuff under the name unplugred.<br/>
after studying audio engineering i decided to make my own vst plugins for me and my friends because i was frustrated with the current offerrings.<br/>
eventually i decided to release them onto the internet as open source because why not.<br/>
in here youd find no resistors, transitors, capacitors, or diodes modeled. no emulation of anything.<br/>
these are completely a result of my own exploration of code and sound, and as a result some of them are good, while others not so much.<br/>
i hope these bring you joy and would love to hear what u make with them.<br/>
u can reach me via discord (@unplugred) and email (melody@unplug.red).<br/>
also! our discord community made a <a href="https://unplugcord.bandcamp.com/album/selected-unplug-works-1" target="_blank">really cool collaborative ambient album that you should check out</a> !!<br/>
lastly, thanks to <a href="https://laulaulau.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">lau</a>, this wouldnt exist without her.`,

<br/>
<b>Q: Why Patreon?<br/>
A:</b> i cannot afford to pay rent only some of the time.<br/>
before i moved to patreon the income i got from this fluctuated a lot.<br/>
patreon allows me to have a stable income i can rely on.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: But I dont like subscriptions<br/>
A:</b> the everything bundle used to be worth 100$ before i moved to patreon.<br/>
this is a low price considering people pay 90$ for a single plugin.<br/>
if youre at the lowest tier of my patreon, it would take u 20 months to get to that amount.<br/>
if having a reoccuring payment stresses you out thats understandable, but one time donations wont help me do this full time.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: But I don't have money<br/>
A:</b> music creation should not be gatekept by money.<br/>
thats why i made the free versions.<br/>
theres no shame in using them and they are fully functional.<br/>
i promise i wont judge.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: I found a bug!<br/>
A:</b> THANK YOU for your effort to report bugs<br/>
bug reports are always always appreciated.<br/>
it would mean a lot for me if you could include:<br/>
- graphics card model<br/>
- operating system<br/>
- daw<br/>
- vst3/clap/au?<br/>
- detailed steps to reproduce the bug<br/>
- a screenshot if applicable<br/>
- does it happen in other daws? (reaper has infinite trial)<br/>
send the bug reports to either my mail (melody@unplug.red) or my discord (@unplugred).<br/>
thanks again, greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: Can I get 32bit support?<br/>
A:</b> right now maintaining 32bit versions is not worth the effort.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: Can I get AAX support?<br/>
A:</b> unfortunately i do not have the money to buy a pro tools license, nor do i intend on supporting their guidelines to get a developer license, which require anti piracy measures to be installed.<br/>
i think these kind of measures make the end product worse, annoy the customer, and ultimately do not achieve their goal.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: Can I get VST2 support?<br/>
A:</b> steinberg has stopped issueing developer licenses for vst2 in 2018, and unfortunately its illegal for me to distribute vst2 versions without one.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: Can I have ___ feature?<br/>
A:</b> you are more than welcome to shoot me an email at melody@unplug.red, but do know that i am just one person and i dont do this full time, and i cant afford to add every requested feature as they take a lot of time to make.<br/>
custom versions of the plugins are an option with appropriate financial compensation.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: How do you make these?<br/>
A:</b> the plugins are made in c++ via the juce framework and cmake.<br/>
ui is made with blender, paint.net, glimpse, inkscape, and imagemagick.<br/>
website runs in an ubuntu vps running an nginx reverse proxy redirected to nodejs instances running via pm2 that have express for routing and ejs for backend, with vanilla js, html and css for the front end.<br/>
demo videos are made and edited in blender for no good reason.<br/>
music is made in reaper.<br/>
text editor is neovide (vim).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: How do I make these???<br/>
A:</b> <a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=329696" target="_blank">theres an excellent thread on the kvr forums</a> about good entry points to audio plugin making and audio programming in general.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: Whats the difference between the free and paid versions?<br/>
A:</b> in the paid version you support me and in the other u dont.<br/>
also, the free version has a strip that says ur using the free version.<br/>
also also using the paid version statistically means ur about 20% more handsome.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: I have a cat video to send you!! (its rly cute)<br/>
A:</b> what are you waiting for??<br/>
all cat videos are welcome at mail (melody@unplug.red) or discord (@unplugred).
id also love to hear any music you made with my plugins, and feel free to send me any album recommendations of bands youd think id like as well.`,

unique reverb plugin whose characteristics you can draw in the form of a curve.<br/>
for example, you can have a reverse reverb with an oscillating lowpass, with a tail that starts panned left and ends up panned right.<br/>
or, you could have a reverb with a tail that goes wub wub wub wub and the end of the tail is pitched up an octave.<br/>
<br/>
hold ctrl while dragging the length knob to sync to bpm.<br/>
more chaotic and textural results can be achieved by reducing the density parameter, and the plugin can enter multi-tap delay mode by turning the density knob all the way down.<br/>
<br/>
due to the plugin's extensive use of convolution, it is somewhat cpu heavy.<br/>
if youre experiencing problems, try increasing the buffer size!`,

		description: `
a type of effect that causes added harmonics as well as a gating effect.<br/>
compared to typical gates and expanders, this one does not use an envelope follower for the gating effect, resulting in gating without pumping<br/>
the added harmonics might not be noticeable or even pleasant on an already dirty signal such as a guitar.<br/>
as a result, this makes it great for applications such as removing humming on a direct guitar signal before applying heavy distortion.<br/>
also sounds great on drum loops and results in a very choppy effect.<br/>
APPLY BEFORE DISTORTION FOR IDEAL EFFECT.<br/>
