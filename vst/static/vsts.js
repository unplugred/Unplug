		description: `hi! ✌<br/>
im ari (they them). on the internet i release stuff under the name unplugred.<br/>
after studying audio engineering i decided to make my own vst plugins for me and my friends because i was frustrated with the current offerrings.<br/>
eventually i decided to release them onto the internet as open source because why not.<br/>
in here youd find no resistors, transitors, capacitors, or diodes modeled. no emulation of anything.<br/>
these are completely a result of my own exploration of code and sound, and as a result some of them are good, while others not so much.<br/>
i hope these bring you joy and would love to hear what u make with them.<br/>
u can reach me on discord (red#3510) and email (hello@unplug.red).<br/>
shout out to my friend lau she makes rly good music <a href="https://laulaulau.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">check her out</a>.`,

<b>Q: I found a bug!<br/>
A:</b> THANK YOU for your effort to report bugs<br/>
bug reports are always always appreciated.<br/>
it would mean a lot for me if you could include:<br/>
- graphics card model<br/>
- operating system<br/>
- daw<br/>
- vst3/clap/au?<br/>
- detailed steps to reproduce the bug<br/>
- a screenshot if applicable<br/>
- does it happen in other daws? (reaper has infinite trial)<br/>
send the bug reports to either my mail (hello@unplug.red) or my discord (red#3510).<br/>
thanks again, greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: Can I get 32bit support?<br/>
A:</b> right now maintaining 32bit versions is not worth the effort.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: Can I get AAX support?<br/>
A:</b> unfortunately i do not have the money to buy a pro tools license, nor do i intend on supporting their guidelines to get a developer license, which require anti piracy measures to be installed.<br/>
i think these kind of measures make the end product worse, annoy the customer, and ultimately do not achieve their goal.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: Can I get VST2 support?<br/>
A:</b> steinberg has stopped issueing developer licenses for vst2 in 2018, and unfortunately its illegal for me to distribute vst2 versions without one.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: Can I have ___ feature?<br/>
A:</b> you are more than welcome to shoot me an email at hello@unplug.red, but do know that i am just one person and i dont do this full time, and i cant afford to add every requested feature as they take a lot of time to make.<br/>
custom versions of the plugins are an option with appropriate financial compensation.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: How do you make these?<br/>
A:</b> the plugins are made in c++ via the juce framework and cmake.<br/>
ui is made with blender, paint.net, glimpse, inkscape, and imagemagick.<br/>
website runs in an ubuntu vps running an nginx reverse proxy redirected to nodejs instences running via pm2 that have express for routing and ejs for backend, with vanilla js, html and css for the front end.<br/>
demo videos are made and edited in blender for no good reason.<br/>
music is made in reaper.<br/>
text editor is neovide (vim).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: How do I make these???<br/>
A:</b> <a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=329696" target="_blank">theres an excellent thread on the kvr forums</a> about good entry points to audio plugin making and audio programming in general.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: Whats the difference between the free and paid versions?<br/>
A:</b> in the paid version you support me and in the other u dont.<br/>
also, the free version has a strip that says ur using the free version.<br/>
also also using the paid version statistically means ur about 20% more handsome.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Q: I have a cat video to send you!! (its rly cute)<br/>
A:</b> what are you waiting for??<br/>
all cat videos are welcome at mail (hello@unplug.red) or discord (red#3510).
id also love to hear any music you made with my plugins, and feel free to send me any album recommendations of bands youd think id like as well.`,

a type of effect that causes added harmonics as well as a gating effect.<br/>
compared to typical gates and expanders, this one does not use an envelope follower for the gating effect, resulting in gating without pumping<br/>
the added harmonics might not be noticeable or even pleasant on an already dirty signal such as a guitar.<br/>
as a result, this makes it great for applications such as removing humming on a direct guitar signal before applying heavy distortion.<br/>
also sounds great on drum loops and results in a very choppy effect.<br/>
APPLY BEFORE DISTORTION FOR IDEAL EFFECT.<br/>

unique reverb plugin whose characteristics you can draw in the form of a curve.<br/>
for example, you can have a reverse reverb with an oscillating lowpass, with a tail that starts panned left and ends up panned right.<br/>
or, you could have a reverb with a tail that goes wub wub wub wub and the end of the tail is pitched up an octave.<br/>
<br/>
more chaotic and textural results can be achieved by reducing the density parameter, and the plugin can also be used as a multi-tap delay by turning the density knob all the way down, with each point representing a tap.<br/>
give it a try! stuff can get really interesting really fast.<br/>
