		description: `hi! ✌<br/>
im ari (they them). on the internet i release stuff under the name unplugred.<br/>
after studying audio engineering i decided to make my own vst plugins for me and my friends because i was frustrated with the current offerrings.<br/>
eventually i decided to release them onto the internet as open source because why not.<br/>
in here youd find no resistors, transitors, capacitors, or diodes modeled. no emulation of anything.<br/>
these are completely a result of my own exploration of code and sound, and as a result some of them are good, while others not so much.<br/>
i hope these bring you joy and would love to hear what u make with them.<br/>
u can reach me on discord (red#3510) and email (unplugred@gmail.com).<br/>
shout out to my friend lau she makes rly good music <a href="https://laulaulau.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">check her out</a>.`,

<b>Q: I found a bug!<br/>
A:</b> THANK YOU for your effort to report bugs<br/>
bug reports are always always appreciated.<br/>
it would mean a lot for me if you could include:<br/>
- graphics card model<br/>
- cpu model<br/>
- operating system<br/>
- daw<br/>
- vst2 or vst3?<br/>
- detailed steps to reproduce the bug<br/>
- a screenshot if applicable<br/>
send the bug reports to either my mail (unplugred@gmail.com) or my discord (red#3510).<br/>
thanks again, greatly appreciated.<br/>
<b>Q: I found a bug in the Linux version!<br/>
A:</b> i sadly do not accept bug reports for the linux version.<br/>
since these plugins are open source, you are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/unplugred/vsts" target="_blank">make a pull request</a>.<br/>
<b>Q: Can I get 64bit support?<br/>
A:</b> 32bit support is buggy currently but i do intend on getting it working in the future.<br/>
<b>Q: Can I get AAX suppoprt?<br/>
A:</b> unfortunately i do not have the money to buy a pro tools license, nor do i intend on supporting their guidelines to get a developer license, which require anti piracy measures to be installed.<br/>
i think these kind of measures make the end product worse, annoy the customer, and ultimately do not achieve their goal.<br/>
<b>Q: Can I get CLAP support?<br/>
A:</b> i intend on supporting clap once reaper supports it so i could begin testing.<br/>
<b>Q: Can I get Mac support?<br/>
A:</b> i do not have the money to buy a mac to properly develop for it.<br/>
<b>Q: Can I have ___ feature?<br/>
A:</b> you are more than welcome to shoot me an email at unplugred@gmail.com, but do know that i am just one person and i dont do this full time, and i cant afford to add every requested feature as they take a lot of time to make.<br/>
custom versions of the plugins are an option with appropriate financial compensation.<br/>
<b>Q: How do you make these?<br/>
A:</b> the plugins are made in C++ via the JUCE framework.<br/>
ui is made with blender, paint.net, glimpse, and imagemagick.<br/>
demo videos are made and edited in blender for no good reason.<br/>
music is made in reaper.<br/>
text editor is neovide (vim).<br/>
<b>Q: Whats the difference between the free and paid versions?<br/>
A:</b> in the paid version you support me and in the other u dont<br/>
also using the paid version statistically means ur about 20% more handsome.<br/>
<b>Q: I have a cat video to send you!! (its rly cute)<br/>
A:</b> what are you waiting for??<br/>
all cat videos are welcome at mail (unplugred@gmail.com) or discord (red#3510).
id also love to hear any music you made with my plugins, and feel free to send me any album recommendations of bands youd think id like as well.`,

a type of effect that causes added harmonics as well as a gating effect.<br/>
compared to typical gates and expanders, this one does not use an envelope follower for the gating effect, resulting in gating without pumping<br/>
the added harmonics might not be noticable or even pleasant on an already dirty signal such as a guitar.<br/>
as a result, this makes it great for applications such as removing humming on a direct guitar signal before applying heavy distortion.<br/>
also sounds great on drum loops and results in a very choppy effect.<br/>
