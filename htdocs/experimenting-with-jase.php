			<b>Experimenting with jase.</b>

			<p>
			Jase and I talked a bit about art and so one day he came to me with an idea.</br>
			the idea was an hourglass, with boat written upon it.
			</p>
			<p>
			after hearing it, i then procceeded to attempt to recreate it.

			after a bit, jase came to me with a picture of his original idea.

			<p>
			seeing it, i decided i should try my hand at making it glittery

			subjectivity is cool.

			<p>
			another day, jase came to me with a cool sketch he had called "Torn"

			</p>
			<p>
			providing me with a short description as to how it would look digitalized, i attempted at recreating it.

			at another time, jase came to me with the following inspiration: blue and red, melting flower.
			</p>
			<p>
			given these instructions, i came up with the following:
